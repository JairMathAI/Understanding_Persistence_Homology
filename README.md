# Persistence Homotopy

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook offers an accessible and visual, step-by-step guide to the abstract definition and construction of homotopy. Homotopy is a powerful tool in both pure mathematics and Topological Data Analysis. The notebook also includes practical examples and Python applications.

This material was created for my presentation at the Knowledge Sharing Seminar for the [AMBION research group](https://www.isas.de/en/research/research-groups/ambiom), where I am a member. It was also designed for use in future presentations on the topic.

## In order to use

Create a new anaconda enviroment

```bash
conda create -y -n persistence_homology -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate persistence_homology
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JairMathAI/Understanding_Persistence_Homology.git
cd Understanding_Persistence_Homology
```

Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Jupyter Lab and now you can use the  Persisten_Homology.ipynb
