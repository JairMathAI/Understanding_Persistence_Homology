# Persistence Homology

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook offers an accessible and visual, step-by-step guide to the abstract definition and construction of Homology. Homology is a powerful tool in both pure mathematics and Topological Data Analysis. The notebook also includes practical examples and Python applications.

This material was created for my presentation at the Knowledge Sharing Meeting for the [AMBION research group](https://www.isas.de/en/research/research-groups/ambiom), where I am a member. It was also designed for use in future presentations on the topic.
